### Known Limitations

1. **No Backend**: Data resets on page reload (in-memory state only)
2. **No Authentication**: All data is public to the user
3. **No TypeScript**: Runtime type checking limited to conditional guards
4. **No Tests**: No unit/integration/E2E test suite (future enhancement)
5. **SearchBar.jsx**: Legacy component file exists but unused (kept for backward compatibility)

2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run build` to create production bundle
